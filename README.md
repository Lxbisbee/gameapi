"Throne Of Games" - Final capstone project for Coding Academy

This web app allows me to catalog all of my video games and keep a running total of the value of my game library.
The search function includes a third party API that requires an API key from IGDB.com to be inserted in the game.js file in the 
$scope.searchIgdb function.
